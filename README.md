# Binance Bot

This bot's purpose is to pull prices from Binance's public side API. 

I have coded the bot to return last price versus Tether, the past hour based on the Binance candlesticks, past 24 hour change and the price versus bitcoin (AKA satoshi's). 

Example Command: .b VEN

Output:

Symbol: VEN

Last Price USDT: $8.29

1 Hour Change: 2.13% (as of 1/21/2018 11:00:00 PM)

24 Hour Change: 13.25%

Price Versus BTC: 0.00070645
